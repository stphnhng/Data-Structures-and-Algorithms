### Homework 1
Link: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/17sp/hw1/Homework1.pdf

Homework Description:
This homework will give you an opportunity to implement the Queue ADT over a linked
list data structure. Additionally, it will introduce you to basic concepts of behavior testing
and debugging.

### Homework 2

Homework Description:
In this assignment, you will implement the Priority Queue ADT (represented by the PriorityQueue.java
interface). You will do this by creating your own BinaryHeap class that
implements PriorityQueue. Again, you will also create a simple testing suite for PriorityQueues.


### Homework 3

Homework Description:
In this assignment, you will implement the Dictionary ADT (represented by the Dictionary.java
interface). You will do this by creating five separate implementations that use the
interface: unsorted linked list, unsorted array, sorted linked list, sorted array and binary
search tree. Instead of creating a dictionary suite that tests functionality, you will be asked
to create a report which shows the runtimes off the three dictionary functions across the five
different implementations.

### Homework 4

Homework Description:
For this assignment, you will develop a graph representation. You will be using this graph
representation for the next homework assignment to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding
shortest paths.

### Homework 5

Homework Description:
For this assignment, you will use your graph representation from HW4 to implement Dijkstra’s
algorithm for finding shortest paths. 

### Homework 6
Link: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/17sp/hw6/index.html

Homework Description:
Your task is to use comparison sorting to unscramble pieces of images that your program will download from a remote server. You will compare the performance of two sorting algorithms, SelectionSort and MergeSort. In order to accomplish this, you will first implement the sorting algorithms for Integers. This is the required starting point, because it will be much easier for you to debug and test your code on Integers. Once your sorts are working with integers, you will implement both sorts for the Packet class that we provide.
