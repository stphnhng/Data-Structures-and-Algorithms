/**
 * This class implements a Comparator for Packet objects. Two Packets are
 * compared using their majorPacketIndex and minorPacketIndex. The bytes held
 * within the packet are completely ignored during the comparison. The size of
 * the bytes within the packet are completely ignored during the comparison. You
 * should only consider the major and minor packet indexes when implementing the
 * comparison. See IntegerComparator for guidelines on how to implement this
 * class.
 * Example Usage:
 * 
    Comparator<Packet> comparator = new PacketComparator();
    if (comparator.compare(packet1, packet2) == 0) {
        System.out.println("The two packets are equal");
    } else if (comparator.compare(packet1, packet2) < 0) {
        System.out.println("The first packet is considered to be less than the second packet");
    } else {
        System.out.println("The first packet is considered to be greater than the second packet");
    }
 * 
 * 
 * A note about comparators:
 * 
 * A comparator guarantees to return an integer less
 * than 0 if the first parameter is less than the second, the integer 0 if the
 * two parameters are considered equal, and an integer greater than 1 if the
 * first parameter is larger than the second. Comparators make no guarantee
 * about the magnitude of the returned value. So, a comparator that returns -11
 * in the first case, 0 in the second case, and 120100390 in the third case is
 * valid. A comparator that returns -1 in the first case, 0 in the second case,
 * and 1 in the third case is also valid.
